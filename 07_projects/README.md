## ADC example and Digital Filtering<a name="step1"></a>

### Purpose

The ADCHS Polled example code has been modified with Digital filtering functions to enable a very accurate analog reading for application such as Battery Voltage Measurement.

In this sample code, the ADC channel AN9 has been used because it is easily available on the MikroBUS Header or on the Xpro Header of the PIC32WFI32E Curiosity Board.

</p>

To reduce the noise of the measurement and get a stable 12-bit ADC, two digital filtering techniques have been implemented in the code.

* Introduction of a Lowpass filter for DC interpolation
  - The Lowpass filter is the easiest to implement and it is adjustable.
  - But, because the Tau is very long (to block the noise as much as possible ), it has the disadvantage of long time sampling before getting the conversion result (about 10 to 20 seconds). To avoid such delay, a +/-20mV barrier was introduced. Any change outside this barrier will lead to load the actual input into the filter taps. And only when the difference between input and output is less than 20mV, the filter is used. The filter reaches its final value much faster but still strongly lowpasses/average/interpolate the result.

* Introduction of a 3rd order polynom to compensate Gain and Offset error
  - To find the coefficients of the Polynom, the program [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org/) has been used.
  - The Scilab script that calculate the compensation polynom coefficient is part of the MPLAB X project in `adchs_polled\firmware\src\calib.sce`.
  - It is necessary to measure in parallel with a good multimeter and read the results also from the terminal. Then put these two rows of data into the script to get the coefficients for the polynom.
  - The calculation is done in emulated float and need 560 instruction cycles (14us@40MHz (Flash bandwidth)).

With the two actions above, it is possible to achieve an accuracy of 1mV within less a second. 

### Try it

1. Clone/download the repo
2. Open the project located in `PIC32MZW1_Workshop/07_projects/resources/software/adchs_polled_with_filtering` with MPLAB X IDE
3. Build and program the code
4. Connect a 3.3V battery to AN9 channel
5. Observe the result on the console

```bash
ADC Count = 0xfff, ADC Input Voltage = 3.231248 V
```

## Touch example with CVD and QT7 Xpro

### Purpose
Basic CVD provides a touch interface based on selfcapacitance touch sensing. The ADC module embedded in the PIC32MZ-W1 device supports CVD feature by using the shared ADC core to perform a modified scan of all second and third class channels.

### Hardware setup

- Connect [QT7 Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atqt7-xpro) to Xpro Header of the WFI32E Curiosity board
- **J211** jumper shorted between pin 2-3 to get IRQ line
- **J209** open that disconnect on-board temperature sensor thus one of the slider Y-line is sharing the same pin

- âš  Known issue with MHC v3.6.2\
When generating the Touch code (`touch.c`), two functions are generating as `qtm_ptc...` while they should be `qtm_cvd...`
  - Open file `touch.c` located in `config/default/touch` folder and apply the following changes
  - In function `touch_sensors_config()`\
  Replace `qtm_ptc_init_acquisition_module(&qtlib_acq_set1);`\
  by `qtm_cvd_init_acquisition_module(&qtlib_acq_set1);`
  - In function `touch_process()`\
  Replace `touch_ret = qtm_ptc_start_measurement_seq(&qtlib_acq_set1, qtm_measure_complete_callback);`\
  by `touch_ret = qtm_cvd_start_measurement_seq(&qtlib_acq_set1, qtm_measure_complete_callback);`
  - With the above modifications, the compilation will success

- Open `initialization.c` and observe that during generation, MHC added automatically the function which initialize the touch library (`touch_init()`)

- Open and modify `main.c` as below

```
#include <stddef.h>                     // Defines NULL
#include <stdbool.h>                    // Defines true
